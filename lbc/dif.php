            <li style="padding:5px;">We trust our customers and we work hard to earn their trust. This means we do not ask for money in advance unless it is to purchase materials. We want our customers to be 100% satisfied and we back up this statements with a 100% money back guarantee.</li>

<li style="padding:5px;">We always clean up after every project.</li>
 
                <li style="padding:5px;">Our estimates may be higher becase we provide you with budget estimates. We promise never to go over our estimates, unless the scope of the job changes. However, if the job does not require the hours we estimated we will only invoice you for the actual time worked on your project.</li>
