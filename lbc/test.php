            <h2>We have grown mainly by referrals with very little advertising. We welcome your feedback!</h2>
            <p>"This gentleman replaced our bathtub faucet. We were well satisfied with the results. He was very professional and knew the plumbing trade. His fee was very reasonable also. I would recommend him to anyone looking for a handyman."</p>
 
            <h3>Home Advisor Customer, Des Moines</h3>
 
<p>"This job was to install 3 doors. The finished doors look very good. The quality of the wood they selected for me made a world of difference when installed"</p>
 
<h3>Barbara J, West Des Moines</h3>
 
<p>"The first part is done but it was a very small job. I am waiting on the weather to warm up to get rid of the ground frost so he can do the other part of the project. So far the communications skills are great and their job expense method is also great. Fixed rate labor with materials separate."</p>
 
<h3>Dan S, Des Moines</h3>
 
 <p>"Two gentlemen arrived early! They repaired my bifold door that was off the hinges and discovered a light fixture that needed repair. Getting to that light fixture wasn't easy and they did it with good humor. They did not charge me a "walk in fee of $75" just to smell the air. They charged me by the hour they worked. I hired them for a second project immediately. They're prompt, clean, happy, and knowledgeable. They're unafraid of heights----an essential when you live in an A-frame house. They charge for the work they do plus the materials, period. No charge just to walk in the door."</p>
 
<h3>Joan M., Des Moines</h3>
 
<p>"They were very friendly and easy to work with. I also really like that they are honest about how they charge. They charge by the hour, and then the cost of the supplies. The job cost less than I had expected."</p>
 
<h3>Lisa S., West Des Moines</h3>
 
<p>"Very prompt and professional and did a great job! In the spring, I am planning on having some work done on the inside of my garage and plan on having LIL Brother Construction do this work for me!"</p>
 
<h3>Debra S, , West Des Moines</h3>
