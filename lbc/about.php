            <p>Lil Brother Construction is now a family owned handyman business that has been in operation since 2008.   We have over 50 years of combined construction and home repair experience.  We began our handyman services out of the desire to help others.  Steve started doing and assisting others with their projects for family members, friends and neighbors.  We were available to help whenever someone needed something done around the house or business, whether they were building a garage, deck, patio or something minor like needing a faucet changed, a ceiling fan installed, deck cleaned or garbage disposal repaired.  We are now the construction company that people turn to for help on their household projects.</p>
            
            <p>No jobs have ever been too small.  We like the projects the larger companies don't have the time or don't want the bother.  Whatever you need done around your house or business, whether you are building or repairing a deck, fixing some drywall repaired, remodeling a bath or basement or something minor like needing a faucet changed, a ceiling fan installed, a deck cleaned or a garbage disposal installed.   Just give Lil' Brother Construction your "Honey Do List".  Our customers include many loyal homeowners as well as commercial and property management companies.  We maintain the top rankings with Angie's List and Home Advisors.  We provide free budget estimates and are fully insured and licensed.  We back our handyman services with our 100% money back service guarantee.  We strive to provide the highest level of service and communication from the moment you call to schedule your budget estimate, to when your job is complete.</p>
